# Replicate-memory-cache-master
A replicated memory cache allows quick access to data using multiple servers.  Data gets saved in memory as a key/value pair to any of the cache servers, and then the data is replicated to other connected servers. This process enables servers in any location to serve and speed up requests to different geographic regions.
